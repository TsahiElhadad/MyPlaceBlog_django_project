Blog website using django platform.


I ch◊ùose to build my site using Django platform, which is very popular among Python programmers. In addition, I used bootstrap,
html, css to design the site and build the pages. 


The site is a blog that simulates an app such as Twitter, having a registration system and user login.
Users share their stories with each other and there is an ability to be interested in the stories of a unique user 
using a filter I been created.


I enjoyed building the site with the help of Django platform and it was very effective for my purpose.
